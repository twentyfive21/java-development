# Interesting piece of code : 
- User-Friendly: It provides a user-friendly interface by allowing users to select options using letters (a, b, c).
- Input Validation: It performs input validation by converting the user's input to lowercase using toLowerCase() method. This ensures that the switch statement doesn't have to handle different cases for uppercase and lowercase inputs, making the code cleaner.
- Recursion for Error Handling: It uses recursion for error handling. If the user enters an invalid option, the default case prints an error message and calls the getUserInput() method again, allowing the user to input a valid option without exiting the program. This approach enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback.
- Clear and Concise: The code is concise and easy to understand. It presents a clear prompt to the user, handles input validation and error cases effectively, and calls the appropriate methods based on the user's choice, making the overall program flow straightforward and efficient.

### Overall, this code demonstrates good practices in user interaction, input validation, error handling, and code readability.
